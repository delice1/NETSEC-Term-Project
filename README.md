# NETSEC-Term-Project

The purpose of this project was to research vulnerabilities in current-day pacemakers. Using NS-3, the group was able to simulate the interactions between a pacemaker, home transmitter, and doctor's access point. Analyzing a variety of attacks, the group was able to demonstrate and research a variety of vulnerabilities that exist in pacemakers and IoT devices today.
